# nyctophobia
a horror game about the daylight vanishing from the world

## STORY
    - you play as alex, who suffers from nyctophobia (phobia of the dark)
	- intro cutscene: "the world has been thrown into darkness for several weeks now. i ran away from home, but i need answers. i need light." mc enters an apartment building
	- the concept is that the first floor will be of an apartment building, second floor will be an office floor, third floor will be a fever dream, ranging from machinery to open landscapes, etc. behind each door
	- you will be collecting either candles in the last floor (easy ending) or parts of a medical report across all rooms (hard ending)
	- when you collect all candles or pieces of paper, you will get a cutscene leading to one of the two endings mentioned below


## MECHANICS
	- basic things like moving through rooms, etc.
	- sanity - you have five points, you lose a point by moving into a dark room or by searching a room, you gain two points by smoking a cigarette or full points for being in a naturally lit up environment
		(rooms lit up by flares dont give sanity but also dont take away sanity)
	- you can search a room to find an item
	- items - see items section
	- flares - there will only be one flare you can have, which you will be able to place in a room - you can then also pick up the flare and then carry it to a different room
		(the flare will be off when you hold it, so you dont gain anything from holding it)
	- locked doors - you need to unlock them, when you do, they stay unlocked; there are two ways to unlock a door:
		- keypad - see minigame entry
		- key - you need to find the key, finding it gets added to the gamestate, then the door is unlocked

## MINIGAMES

keypad minigame - three difficulties - easy for early levels, medium for later levels, hard for reality ending

	- basically wordle but with numbers, easy will be 4 numbers, medium 5, hard 6/7

## ENDINGS
all will be cutscenes
    1 (game over) - you die because of loss of sanity - slicing your throat, blood coming out of them, slowly collapsing on the floor (done in studio)

    2 (easy ending) - you sucessfully do the ritual - the dark leaves, you are in the light (in snow, scene done twice, at night and at day)
    
    3 (hard ending) - you find the medical report - you realize that everything that is happening is caused by your mental illness (recorded at home i think?)
        - you need to piece together all parts of the medical report, each hidden behind a hard keypad minigame
